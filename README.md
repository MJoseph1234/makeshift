# MakeShift

MakeShift is a tool for making procedurally generated text based on pre-defined phrase templates. 

This package includes a simple specification for how to write MakeShift-style phrase templates and an interpreter for generating text from those templates.

MakeShift is designed for dungeon masters, writers and storytellers of all kinds to help come up with ideas and find inspiration when making new `{ characters | settings | stories | worlds | anything }`.

## Installation

MakeShift can be installed from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/makeshift/) using Pip. I recommend doing this in a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
```bash
> pip install makeshift
```

You can call `makeshift` from the command-line and provide a phrase template file to generate a random result.

```bash
> makeshift /path/to/file/my_template.txt
```
