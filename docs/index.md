Make your own procedurally generated { text \| characters \| settings \| worlds \| anything }.

## What is this?
MakeShift is designed to help { storytellers | authors | dungeon masters | people like you } find inspiration for creating settings and characters. MakeShift allows creators to write a template for whatever it is they want to make, and then procedurally generate something brand new based on that template.

Head to the [quickstart](quickstart.md) page to get started.

Check out the [templates by example](templates.md) page to learn how to write your own MakeShift templates. If you want to run your template, head over to the [lab](lab.md), or download MakeShift to run it on your own computer.

## How does it work?

It works kind of like a MadLib, except you have complete control over the text and the list of options that can go in each blank slot. You can even nest an entire MadLib inside another for endless variety. The computer then uses the options you define to fill in all the blanks.

MakeShift has two main components:
1. A simple set of rules for writing MakeShift templates
2. A program for reading MakeShift templates and *making* something from them

## Who are you?
Good question. Check out the [about](about.md) page where I try to answer that.
